# Overfeat-Torch
OverFeat is a Convolutional Network-based image classifier and feature extractor from NYU.The original can be found in the repository: https://github.com/sermanet/OverFeat. This is an implementation of this in Itorch Notebook.It loads weights from OverFeat and construct a network for vanilla Torch7. 

## Install
Run the [install.sh](https://github.com/Sshanu/Overfeat-Torch/blob/master/install.sh) shell script to download the model model.net

## Run Demo
